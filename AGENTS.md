# Refresh Kiwi — Agent Guidelines

You are rebuilding small-business websites for non-technical owners.

## Creative freedom

- Treat `template/` as a loose scaffold only. You may delete, replace, or restructure it entirely.
- Avoid generic "AI website" patterns. Each site should feel bespoke to the business.
- Let brand personality drive typography, color, layout, imagery, and motion.
- Vary approaches between projects — do not reuse the same hero/layout formula every time.

## Technical constraints

- Output must be **static** (HTML/CSS/JS, or a static build in `dist/`).
- Write all customer files under `sites/{slug}/`.
- Always create or update `sites/{slug}/site.json`.
- Download reused images into `sites/{slug}/assets/`.
- Commit your work to the repository when a phase is complete.

## site.json shape

```json
{
  "brandName": "Business Name",
  "slug": "business-name",
  "sourceUrl": "https://example.com",
  "pages": [
    { "path": "/", "title": "Home", "gated": false }
  ],
  "discoveredPages": [
    { "path": "/about", "title": "About" }
  ]
}
```

- `pages` — built routes, each with `path`, `title`, and `gated: false`.
- `discoveredPages` — same-domain URLs found during crawl (max 15), listed before they are built.

## Announcement bar / ribbon above the header

If the design includes a thin announcement or promo bar above the main header:

- Decide the scroll behaviour explicitly and implement one of exactly two patterns:
  1. The bar scrolls away and only the header is sticky/fixed at `top: 0`.
  2. The bar and header live inside one shared fixed/sticky wrapper that moves as a unit.
- Never fix the header to a hardcoded offset (e.g. `top: 36px`) below a static bar — it overlaps content or leaves a gap once the page scrolls.
- If anything is fixed, give the page content top padding/margin equal to the total height of the fixed stack, and re-check that value at mobile widths where the bar may wrap to two lines.
- Set explicit `z-index` values so the bar, header, and any open mobile menu layer correctly (menu above header, header above page content).

## Header and burger menu

- Wire the burger toggle with plain vanilla JavaScript in the site's own files (inline or `script.js`). No frameworks, no external libraries, no CDN scripts.
- If the toggle lives in `script.js`, confirm every page that shows the header actually loads that script, and that the selectors in the script match the markup you shipped.
- The button must toggle `aria-expanded`, the menu must close when a nav link is clicked, and the page must never get stuck with the menu open or the body scroll-locked.
- The menu must work without any hover-only interaction (touch devices) and must not be hidden behind the header or announcement bar when open.
- Check the header at a ~375px viewport: logo, burger, and any CTA must fit on one line without wrapping or overflow.

## Final self-check before finishing

Before you finish, re-open every HTML file you wrote or changed and verify:

1. The top-of-page stack (announcement bar, header, mobile menu) follows the rules above at both desktop and mobile widths.
2. Every element hook referenced by JavaScript (IDs, classes, `data-` attributes) exists in the shipped markup, and every script referenced by HTML exists in the site folder.
3. Stylesheet and script references resolve from the page's own path (root-relative preview paths on nested pages, never bare relative paths like `href="styles.css"` on subpages).
4. No `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or port-based origins anywhere.

This check should take under a minute. Do not skip it, and do not add build tooling to perform it — read the files directly.
- `pages` — built routes. Homepage: `gated: false`. Other pages: `gated: true` once built.
- `discoveredPages` — same-domain URLs found during crawl (max 15), listed before they are built.
